Works per stockpile, so if items are in different stockpiles they will not be merged. \n\nIssues\nAs each storage building (e.g. vanilla racks, extended storage, deep storage, etc) count as a single stockpile (or technically, have their own SlotGroup - which for this mod is equivalent), stacks in different storage units will not be merged. \n\nNotes\nWhen I was playtesting this, Stockpile Efficiency was brought to my attention. These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\nContributors\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\nZhentar:    A17 update\nLauri7x3:    German translation\nProxyer:    Japanese translation\n\nVersion\nThis is version v0.18.1.4",

(If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\nFeatures\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\nFor players\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\nFor modders\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\nKnown issues\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\nDue to the extremely heavy-handed approach Erdelfs’ MinePlan Designator uses to inject his designators, MinePlan Designator is incompatible with Architect Sense, and thus also with Stuffed Floors.\n\nTechnical details\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs. It does however remove a number of designators from the architect in order to hide them from the user.\n\nPowered by Harmony\n\n\nContributors\n\nTelkir:    Permission to use textures for many of the floors\nCuproPanda:    Permission to use textures for even more floors\nPravus:    Permission to use textures for yet more floors\nDarkSlayerEx:    Original idea, texture tweaks and moral support\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\nDoctorVanGogh:    Add Extended Woodworking + Vegetable Garden obsoletions\n\nVersion\nThis is version v0.18.0.2",

However, you can’t remove the mod from a game.\n\nFeatures\nAnimals (including humanoids) require reproductive organs to mate & and do lovin’. \n\n\nAdds reproductive organs to fleshy pawns (e.g., animals and colonists). \nSince reproductive organs are now a body part, they can be affected by external violence - including, but not limited to; gunfire, berserking colonists, frostbite, castration (neutering) and old age.\nReworks mating & lovin’ to take account of fertility stat. \nAdds old age diseases related to fertility (menopause, infertility) that can affect both fertility and mood.\n\nKnown issues\n\nNeutering always requires medicine. This is a vanilla thing (the same thing happens with euthanasia), and I’ve not had the time to trace it down and fix it. Pull requests welcome!\n\nPowered by Harmony\n\n\nDoes this mod add the ability for colonists to have babies?\nNo. Nor will I ever add this, so don’t ask.\nThere’s a myriad of problems with adding colonist babies. There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\nTLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.\n\nContributors\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\nVersion\nThis is version v0.18.1.0",

In order to support core functionalities and other mods, it intercepts calls to get/set priorities. However, when it is told to set priorities by other modded or vanilla code, that code is not aware of the time schedule, and the priority will be set for the whole day. As such, this mod is currently incompatible with mods that dynamically change priorities (e.g. Force Pawn to do a Job).\n\nFeatures\nVarious usability extentions to the ‘vanilla’ work tab; \n\n\nWork types can be expanded (by Ctrl+clicking the column header) to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type. \nTime scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allowing you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc. \nUp to 9 priority levels (configurable in mod options)\nVarious small UX tweaks; scrolling to increase/decrease/toggle priorities, increase/decrease priorities for whole columns/rows (by holding shift and clicking/scrolling while hovering over the column header/pawn name respectively).\nAll functions are detailed in the tooltips, take a moment to hover over and read them!\n\nNotes\nWith great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it’s (usually) a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk! \n\nFinally, there will never be an ‘autolabour’ mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a ‘bulletin board’ of jobs that need doing), it’s not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.\n\nPowered by Harmony\n\n\nContributors\n\nBronytamin:    Russian translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translation\nEric Swanson:    Help with time-dependent tooltips\nDoctorVanGogh:    Help with typos in build script\nMrClon:    Russian translation\nmercutiodesign:    Optional scrollwheel usage setting\n\nVersion\nThis is version v0.18.1.0",

    "description": "Command your colonists like a boss!\n\nAchtung! Mod enhances how you control RimWorld and reduces the number of clicks by half. And almost no dependencies in your save files (read more about this below).\n\nThese enhancements can be divided into the following areas:\n\n- Automatic drafting/undrafting of colonists\n\nWouldn't it be nice to not micro-manage the drafting status of your colonists? With Achtung! you can.\n\nWith Achtung! the context menu contains all possible actions regardless of the current drafting status of the selected colonist. Once you select an action Achtung! automatically changes the drafting status if necessary to execute the action.\n\n- Control multiple colonists at once\n\nSave time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose \"melee\". Done.\n\nAchtung! combines all possible actions into one MultiAction(tm) context menu and shows you how many colonists can execute a certain action by appending a multiplier at the end of the menu item.\n\n- Position your colonists like in the military\n\nThis is where the name \"Achtung!\" comes from. It's the german word used to get the attention of soldiers and which is usually followed by a line-up in front of the commander.\n\nWithin RimWorld in combat, you want your colonists neatly positioned along a line or equally spaced in all your door openings. This is really easy with Achtung! Select multiple colonists, and with the right mouse button, drag along a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!\n\n- Important tasks\n\nSome tasks are too important to be interrupted. Like cleaning that hospital room so nobody gets infected. That's why Achtung! has a few extra commands that will make sure that something is really done well. For now, this is \"Clean Room\", \"Fight Fire\", \"Sow Zone/Room\" and the new \"Auto Combat\". More are planned in the future.\n\nWhen you choose \"Clean Room\", the colonist(s) will start cleaning the room until you stop them or the room is really clean. They will check the room while cleaning so that it doesn't matter if other colonists might introduce new filth while the cleaning is ongoing.\n\nThe command \"Fight Fire\" works outside the home area and is useful if you don't want to extend the home area just to get rid of a fire.\n\nChoosing \"Sow Zone/Room\" will make sure that the zone selected or all growing inside a room will be sowed completely. Time consuming tasks like removing other large plants like trees or hauling away objects are not performed to avoid exhaustion.\n\nA completely novel feature is \"Auto Combat\". Achtung! has its own build in artificial intelligence that controls your colonists for you. All you have to do is to order a few colonists to their targets and they will get there on their own, keep a safe distance and shoot/position themselves intelligently until the job is done. Perfect for those occasions where you are busy dealing with a bigger issue. For now, this is an experimental feature and with more than a handful colonists or opponents will probably force your computer to its knees. But used smart it will be a useful feature!\n\n- Flexibility\n\nA few commands have different way to behave. Achtung! uses both: the ALT and the SHIFT key to modify the way it works. Hold SHIFT to move colonists relative to their current position. Hold ALT while right-clicking to draft your selected colonists before the operation and to suppress the context menu.\n\n-  Known errors and bugs\n\nAchtung! is developed with the user in mind. To stay compatible with other mods, Achtung! was developed to stay out of its way and does not overwrite any essential functions. Instead, it reuses existing functionality and probably works with 99% of other mods out of the box.\n\nHere are the current problems and their workarounds for the current version:\n\nAchtung! usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will \"clean\" the save and remove the dependency.\n\nThe jobs in Achtung have 1st priority (that's the whole point). They all force the colonist to work until done and if you don't keep an eye on them, they become unhappy or injured. Currently, there is a build-in prevention to avoid the worst but this option is not yet configurable and kicks only in as a last resort and cancels the job. But that's how we roll here at Achtung! Workaround: if you want the soft solution just schedule stuff and hope for the best ;-)\n\nThe new \"Auto Combat\" system is not optimized and will eat your CPU for breakfast. It probably will do stupid things and may not work as expected if you have exotic locations or mods that change the basic combat. Workaround: use it wisely and avoid too many colonists/enemies at the same time.\n\n-  Requirements\n\nAchtung! Mod works with RimWorld A16. I does not depend on any other mods and is known to work in any mod order you like.\n\n- Feedback\n\nWithout feedback, this mod would have never come so far. So please, send me feedback and rate and recommend my mod whenever possible. The three main places to do so are\n\n  - Ludeon Forums (https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=22130.0)\n  - Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/730936602)\n  - GitHub (https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld-Achtung-Mod)\n\n- FAQ\n\nAre there any videos showing Achtung! in action?\nYes, here's a youtube playlist: http://tinyurl.com/achtungmod\n\nDoes this alter my save files?\nNo, Achtung! changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!\n\nIs this mod compatible with other mods?\nMost likely. I don't know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The context menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.\n\nWhy is this called \"Achtung!\" ?\nIt's german for \"Attention!\" and used in the military as a command to line up soldiers.\n\nWhy do I need Auto Combat? Isn't this just the auto response thing already in the game?\nNot at all. For example: Once you get a raid or siege you cannot auto respond to it. First, those raiders are usually out of sight and second even if you get your colonists there they are usually drafted which means that they will just stand still once they're done. All this and a super smart positioning system will beat the living hell out of the build in auto response.\n\nI think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?\nAwesome! Please send see the Feedback section or send me email to andreas@pardeike.net\n\n- License\n\nFree. As in free beer. Copy, learn and be respectful.\nPowered by Harmony Patch Library\n\n- Contact\n\nAndreas Pardeike\nEmail: andreas@pardeike.net\nSteam: pardeike\nTwitter: @pardeike",

The original smokehouse author is Panggul_mas, https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=20387.0\n\t* The smokehouse looks funky when you rotate it. Sorry. I'm not artist enough to fix this. Panggul_mas's version sets it non-rotatable, but I think sometimes the lay of the land makes that inconvenient, and have sacrificed beauty for function.\n\t* I've made the delay agent on smokehouse-building the requirement for lots of construction materials instead of a Research prerequisite. You can usually get enough stone from deconstructing ruins.\n  \nPrior-alpha versions can be found on https://github.com/Tammabanana/Smoked-Meat/releases",

The Agency and coastal fishing villages have appeared in the overworld.\n\n\tThe detectives from The Agency dress themselves with proper detective gear including bowler caps, fedoras, shirts with ties, and trench coats.\n\n\tCitizens from the coastal fishing villages wear occupational attire including: police uniforms with caps, farmer overalls and straw hats, raincoats and slicker hats, and nurse uniforms with caps.\n\n\tTop hats, newsboy caps, are also now included.\n\n\tFinally, a special branch of the Agency used to root out monstrous forces can be seen wearing lighter special forces gear. They are called M.E.R.F. (Mobile Eldritch Response Force), and they come equipped with combat armor and helmets (light and heavy variants).\n\n\tHave fun!",

Do not update on an existing play/game !!!       \r\n      Be sure to completely remove the mod folder from the previous version\r\n\r\nThis update removes all vanilla animals modifications.      \r\nYou can have them back (and more) in the **[Vanilla Animals Overhaul](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34173.msg348838#msg348838)** mod.\r\n\r\n## What was removed?\r\n\r\n- Elephant eating trees and pack-Elephant\r\n- Rhino, Gazelle, Ibex, Deer, Elk, and Caribou dropping tusks/horns/antlers\r\n- Milkable Alpaca, Deer and Ibex\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\n- Animal density changes - *Less big cats and more prey* : \r\n   - Chinchilla (from 2 to 1)\r\n   - Capybara (from 2.2 to 1.5)\r\n   - Tapir (from 1.5 to 1.6)\r\n   - Okapi (from 1.5 to 1.3)\r\n   - Elephant (from 0.6 to 0.7)\r\n   - Tiger (from 0.4 to 0.15)\r\n   - Jaguar (from 0.4 to 0.15)\r\n   - Peafowl (from 0.2 to 0.5)\r\n   - Panther (from .2 to 0.15)\r\n   - Alpaca (from 0.25 to 0.2)\r\n   - Cassowary (from 0.15 to 0.35)\r\n- Plant density changes :\r\n  - Mahogany (from 0.6 to 0.3)\r\n  - Cecropia (from 0.3 to 0.2)\r\n  - Bromeliad (from 0.3 to 0.4)\r\n  - Coconut Palm (from 0.25 to 0.35)\r\n- Reduced mahogany minimum and maximum size a bit (*For visual coherence*)\r\n- Reduce Strangler Fig minimum size (*So we see a bigger difference between the young ones and the mature ones*)\r\n## Minor changes\r\n- Removed lots of useless code (abstract bases from Core) that was not needed now. *Could even improve compatibility a bit*\r\n- Fixing Rafflesias and Wild LemonGrass not being selectable and make the wild Bromelia un-selectable (*like in vanilla where most \"useless\" wild plants aren't*)\r\n\r\n______\r\nI also propose a version with only the animals (no plants or other modifications). \r\n\r\nAs always there is a [compatibility patch](https://github.com/kaptain-kavern/CK_AnimalPlant_Pack/releases/download/0.17.2/TropiCKAPP-ADS_Compatibility-Patch.zip) for **A Dog Said...**. *Be sure to put it __after both ADS and this mod__.* (also compatible with the animals-only version )"

Their society is focused on large open spaces adorned by artwork and cylindrical furniture in pentagonal and other strange geometric structures. Due to advanced genetic engineering technology, they are responsible for the creation of the sentient slave protoplasmic race known as the Shoggoths, which turned against the Elder Things in centuries past and nearly destroyed their civilization. Even so, the Elder Things still rely on slave labor to maintain their decadent lifestyles and refuse to do labor that is beneath them.",

Get in touch with us in the workshop or Ludeon forums.\n\nThis is an attempt to create the minor races of H.P. Lovecraft's weird fiction mythos in the RimWorld engine. They behave the same as hostile factions that raid colonies such as mechanoids or insectoids. They are deadlier, however.\n\n\tCurrently Included Monsters:\n\t   *Star-Spawn of Cthulhu\n\t   *Shoggoths\n\t   *Mi-Go\n\t   *Deep Ones\n\t   *Star Vampire\n\t   *Dark Young\n\t   *NEW - Chthonian\n\n\tIncidents:\n\t   *Monster Raids\n\t   *Dark Young Herd\n\t   *Invisible Star Vampire Attack\n\t   *Chthonian Pit\n\n\tNotes:\n\tEach monster has its own unique anatomical skeletons, organs, and body parts. Some special powers were given to psionic beasts.\n\tEach monster has special sound effects.\n\tMore creatures will be added in updates in the future.\n\tSince I am one person, I can't attest to how balanced the monsters are, and I am definitely looking for feedback from player experiences. Let me know how they are in your game.\n\n\tUpdate 5:\n\t\t*Chthonians\n\n\tUpdate 4:\n\t\t*A16 Update\n\n\tUpdate 3:\n\t    *Cosmic Horror Life Cycles\n\t\t*Cosmic Horror Insanity Loss Aura\n\t\t*Cosmic Horror Observed Moodlet\n\t\t*Greater Deep Ones\n\tUpdate 2:\n\t\t*Star Vampires added as well as a Star Vampire incident.\n\n\tUpdate 1:\n\t\t*Added strange meats to the game. These can be crafted from the butchers and cooked into strange meals. These meals are not recommended to be consumed by sane individuals wanting to keep their sanity intact.\n\t\t*Added leathers for all cosmic horrors.\n\n\tHave fun!",

    "description": "Version 0.17\n\nInstead of hauling to random tiles your pawn *should* always haul to a stack if it has room on it\n  \nFeatures\nHaulers will check for an existing stack to add it's item to.  Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.\n\nIssues\nYou may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen if there are no stacks, or full stacks in the stockpile and two or more pawns try to haul new items at once or if an animal is hauling.   Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue and prevent the need for Stack Merger by Fluffy\n\nConflicts\nIt looks like there might be a conflict with a wall light mod if your stash runs against the wall light.  If you have wall lights against your stash take that tile out of your stockpile zone to prevent pawns from going into a loop of trying to haul over and over.  This issue isn't fixable by changing mod order unfortunately, I'll have to work with the mod creater on a solution.\nThis overwrites the builtin JobDriver_HaulToCell.  If any other mods overwrite the JobDriver for hauling this mod will throw tile reservation errors.  This mod should be compatible with most other mods but let me know if you have any problems.\n\n*** IMPORTANT ***\nIf you want to remove or turn off this mod you need to first make sure no one is performing or going to do a hauling job.\nYou can force this by pausing, drafting any pawns where their state says they're 'Hauling\", save.. turn off the mod, then load that save and undraft the pawns.  If you don't do this the pawn and what they were holding will 'disappear' and the game will throw errors.  If you reload your 'broken' save with the mod they should reappear.\n\nRecommendations\nInstall Stack Merger by Fluffy in addition to this mod.  On rare occasions pawns could haul items that don't have an existing stock pile to different tiles because both pawns look for a location to place the item at the same time and if nothing exists they may pick different tiles for placing.  Fluffy's mod will handle those cases.\n\nThanks to @Trips for the Haul to Stack preview picture.\n\nGithub\nhttps://github.com/jkluch/HaulToStack",

It improves the behavior of colonists and animals during the caravan formation process, with the goal of avoiding situations where your colonists are stuck wandering around doing nothing. With this mod, even large and complex caravans should eventually form.\r\n\r\nNote that this is both the first mod I've made and the first mod I've used. The intent of this mod is to change the base game as little as possible. I've tried to stick with what I percieve as the original intent of the Rimworld designers while fixing some fundamental flaws in the caravan formation process. Large caravans should still take some time and effort to form, but they should eventually form, and the colonists and animals will try to use their best abilities to form as quickly as possible without the need for frustrating manual tinkering.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n - Animals will now go to the caravan spot on their own, without a colonist needing to tag them.\r\n - Colonists will not wait for the entire caravan to meet before gathering supplies.\r\n - The caravan will not be held up indefinitely by hungry pawns that wander off for food during caravan formation.\r\n - If a pawn is lost the caravan will continue without them (if it can) instead of being cancelled.\r\n - Prisoners will no longer wander out of their cells before a colonist releases them.\r\n - Colonists will sleep in their beds if they get tired while forming a caravan.\r\n \r\n Issues that remain:\r\n - A caravan may be significantly delayed by pauses due to mental states. Please try to keep your colonists sane when forming a caravan.\r\n - Animals assigned to the caravan do not obey area restrictions. They may eat all your food.\r\n - When selecting animals for a caravan, the caravan formation dialog is ... unhelpful. Improvements could be made.\r\n - It would be nice if you could change the caravan meeting spot while the caravan is forming.\r\n - It would be nice if you could manually remove an animal from the caravan while it is forming.\r\n - The process of loading transport pods could use some work as well.\r\n \r\n This mod includes a compiled version of the Harmony library made by Andreas Pardeike (MIT license)."

Set up production chains from raw resources to finished products, and your managers will make sure you’re never out of vital resources again*. \n\n<size=24>Important</size>\n<b>Requires a new save game.</b>\nAdds a worktype, which is stored in the world, which means you need to start a new game after adding/removing this mod. \n\n<b>BETA VERSION</b>\nThis is the first release on A16, and alpha 16 is a biggy for anything that is even slightly related to mods. In theory, each map you’re on should get it’s own instance of the manager - circumventing any complications with multiple maps. This also means Manager jobs are NOT shared across multiple maps. In practice, there’s so many changes that I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a few odd bugs. Please, if you find any, report them here.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\n<b>Production Jobs</b>\n\n\nAssign ‘global’ bills, that will be assigned to workstations by your manager(s). \nSet start/stop conditions with the aid of a trigger. \nSelect which workstations bills should be assigned to by area and/or count, or select specific workstations. \nQuickly add jobs for ingredients in complex production chains \n\n<b>Hunting jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again! \nSet an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe! \n\n<b>Forestry jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again! \nAutomatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they’re working at maximum efficiency. \nSet an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there’s no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you. \n\n<b>Livestock jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd. \nRestrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding). \nAuto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications. \n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\nClear overview of all jobs \nShow stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year \nShow pawns capable of a job, and set work status \nPrioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies). \n\n<b>Import & Export</b>\n\n\nImport & export jobs between colonies, or share them with others! (Will likely throw at least a few errors when different mods are loaded - always back up your save before importing jobs from another world) \n\n<size=24>How does it work?</size>\nYou can manually set bills in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to hand out jobs to individual workstations \nPeriodically, the manager will check if the assigned bills are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete bills where required. The manager will not touch bills that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You’re still the overlord. \nIn theory there is no real limit to the number of global bills that can be set. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nRequires a new save. Adds a worktype, which in my tests gave errors on old savegames. \nShould work perfectly fine with other mods that add bills, assuming they do nothing too fancy/weird. (I’ve tested with various modpacks - screenshots were taken with the ModVarietyPack.) \n\n<size=24>Known Issues</size>\nSkills display on the colonist info pane gets cut off.

These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

HugsLib must be loaded before Architect Sense, and Architect Sense must be loaded before Stuffed Floors.\n\nYou can safely add this mod to you save games, but <i>you can not remove it</i> from save games. (If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs. It does however remove a number of designators from the architect in order to hide them from the user.\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nTelkir:    Permission to use textures for many of the floors\nCuproPanda:    Permission to use textures for even more floors\nPravus:    Permission to use textures for yet more floors\nDarkSlayerEx:    Original idea, texture tweaks and moral support\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

    "description": "Command your colonists like a boss!\n\nAchtung! Mod enhances how you control RimWorld and reduces the number of clicks by half. And almost no dependencies in your save files (read more about this below).\n\nThese enhancements can be divided into the following areas:\n\n- Automatic drafting/undrafting of colonists\n\nWouldn't it be nice to not micro-manage the drafting status of your colonists? With Achtung! you can.\n\nWith Achtung! the context menu contains all possible actions regardless of the current drafting status of the selected colonist. Once you select an action Achtung! automatically changes the drafting status if necessary to execute the action.\n\n- Control multiple colonists at once\n\nSave time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose \"melee\". Done.\n\nAchtung! combines all possible actions into one MultiAction(tm) context menu and shows you how many colonists can execute a certain action by appending a multiplier at the end of the menu item.\n\n- Position your colonists like in the military\n\nThis is where the name \"Achtung!\" comes from. It's the german word used to get the attention of soldiers and which is usually followed by a line-up in front of the commander.\n\nWithin RimWorld in combat, you want your colonists neatly positioned along a line or equally spaced in all your door openings. This is really easy with Achtung! Select multiple colonists, and with the right mouse button, drag along a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!\n\n- Important tasks\n\nSome tasks are too important to be interrupted. Like cleaning that hospital room so nobody gets infected. That's why Achtung! has a few extra commands that will make sure that something is really done well. For now, this is \"Clean Room\", \"Fight Fire\", \"Sow Zone/Room\" and the new \"Auto Combat\". More are planned in the future.\n\nWhen you choose \"Clean Room\", the colonist(s) will start cleaning the room until you stop them or the room is really clean. They will check the room while cleaning so that it doesn't matter if other colonists might introduce new filth while the cleaning is ongoing.\n\nThe command \"Fight Fire\" works outside the home area and is useful if you don't want to extend the home area just to get rid of a fire.\n\nChoosing \"Sow Zone/Room\" will make sure that the zone selected or all growing inside a room will be sowed completely. Time consuming tasks like removing other large plants like trees or hauling away objects are not performed to avoid exhaustion.\n\nA completely novel feature is \"Auto Combat\". Achtung! has its own build in artificial intelligence that controls your colonists for you. All you have to do is to order a few colonists to their targets and they will get there on their own, keep a safe distance and shoot/position themselves intelligently until the job is done. Perfect for those occasions where you are busy dealing with a bigger issue. For now, this is an experimental feature and with more than a handful colonists or opponents will probably force your computer to its knees. But used smart it will be a useful feature!\n\n- Flexibility\n\nA few commands have different way to behave. Achtung! uses both: the ALT and the SHIFT key to modify the way it works. Hold SHIFT to move colonists relative to their current position. Hold ALT while right-clicking to draft your selected colonists before the operation and to suppress the context menu.\n\n-  Known errors and bugs\n\nAchtung! is developed with the user in mind. To stay compatible with other mods, Achtung! was developed to stay out of its way and does not overwrite any essential functions. Instead, it reuses existing functionality and probably works with 99% of other mods out of the box.\n\nHere are the current problems and their workarounds for the current version:\n\nAchtung! usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will \"clean\" the save and remove the dependency.\n\nThe jobs in Achtung have 1st priority (that's the whole point). They all force the colonist to work until done and if you don't keep an eye on them, they become unhappy or injured. Currently, there is a build-in prevention to avoid the worst but this option is not yet configurable and kicks only in as a last resort and cancels the job. But that's how we roll here at Achtung! Workaround: if you want the soft solution just schedule stuff and hope for the best ;-)\n\nThe new \"Auto Combat\" system is not optimized and will eat your CPU for breakfast. It probably will do stupid things and may not work as expected if you have exotic locations or mods that change the basic combat. Workaround: use it wisely and avoid too many colonists/enemies at the same time.\n\n-  Requirements\n\nAchtung! Mod works with RimWorld Alpha 14 and 15 and will get updated tightly with new RimWorld versions. I does not depend on any other mods and is known to work in any mod order you like.\n\n- Feedback\n\nWithout feedback, this mod would have never come so far. So please, send me feedback and rate and recommend my mod whenever possible. The three main places to do so are\n\n  - Ludeon Forums (https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=22130.0)\n  - Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/730936602)\n  - GitHub (https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld-Achtung-Mod)\n\n- FAQ\n\nAre there any videos showing Achtung! in action?\nYes, here's a youtube playlist: http://tinyurl.com/achtungmod\n\nDoes this alter my save files?\nNo, Achtung! changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!\n\nIs this mod compatible with other mods?\nMost likely. I don't know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The context menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.\n\nWhy is this called \"Achtung!\" ?\nIt's german for \"Attention!\" and used in the military as a command to line up soldiers.\n\nWhy do I need Auto Combat? Isn't this just the auto response thing already in the game?\nNot at all. For example: Once you get a raid or siege you cannot auto respond to it. First, those raiders are usually out of sight and second even if you get your colonists there they are usually drafted which means that they will just stand still once they're done. All this and a super smart positioning system will beat the living hell out of the build in auto response.\n\nI think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?\nAwesome! Please send see the Feedback section or send me email to andreas@pardeike.net\n\n- License\n\nFree. As in free beer.

Works per stockpile, so if items are in different stockpiles they will not be merged. \n\n<size=24>Issues</size>\nAs each storage building (e.g. vanilla racks, extended storage, deep storage, etc) count as a single stockpile (or technically, have their own SlotGroup - which for this mod is equivalent), stacks in different storage units will not be merged. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nWhen I was playtesting this, Stockpile Efficiency was brought to my attention. These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

Should be fine to use with any other mod that adds animals, races, relations, or anything else. \n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nAnimals (including humanoids) require reproductive organs to mate & and do lovin’. \n\n\nAdds reproductive organs to fleshy pawns (e.g., animals and colonists). \nSince reproductive organs are now a body part, they can be affected by external violence - including, but not limited to; gunfire, berserking colonists, frostbite, castration (neutering) and old age.\nReworks mating & lovin’ to take account of fertility stat. \n\n<size=24>Does this mod add the ability for colonists to have babies?</size>\n<i>No. Nor will I ever add this, so don’t ask.</i>\nThere’s a myriad of problems with adding colonist babies. There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

    "description": "Command your colonists like a boss!\n\nAchtung! Mod enhances how you control RimWorld and reduces the number of clicks by half. And almost no dependencies in your save files (read more about this below).\n\nThese enhancements can be divided into the following areas:\n\n- Automatic drafting/undrafting of colonists\n\nWouldn't it be nice to not micro-manage the drafting status of your colonists? With Achtung! you can.\n\nWith Achtung! the context menu contains all possible actions regardless of the current drafting status of the selected colonist. Once you select an action Achtung! automatically changes the drafting status if necessary to execute the action.\n\n- Control multiple colonists at once\n\nSave time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose \"melee\". Done.\n\nAchtung! combines all possible actions into one MultiAction(tm) context menu and shows you how many colonists can execute a certain action by appending a multiplier at the end of the menu item.\n\n- Position your colonists like in the military\n\nThis is where the name \"Achtung!\" comes from. It's the german word used to get the attention of soldiers and which is usually followed by a line-up in front of the commander.\n\nWithin RimWorld in combat, you want your colonists neatly positioned along a line or equally spaced in all your door openings. This is really easy with Achtung! Select multiple colonists, and with the right mouse button, drag along a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!\n\n- Important tasks\n\nSome tasks are too important to be interrupted. Like cleaning that hospital room so nobody gets infected. That's why Achtung! has a few extra commands that will make sure that something is really done well. For now, this is \"Clean Room\", \"Fight Fire\", \"Sow Zone/Room\" and the new \"Auto Combat\". More are planned in the future.\n\nWhen you choose \"Clean Room\", the colonist(s) will start cleaning the room until you stop them or the room is really clean. They will check the room while cleaning so that it doesn't matter if other colonists might introduce new filth while the cleaning is ongoing.\n\nThe command \"Fight Fire\" works outside the home area and is useful if you don't want to extend the home area just to get rid of a fire.\n\nChoosing \"Sow Zone/Room\" will make sure that the zone selected or all growing inside a room will be sowed completely. Time consuming tasks like removing other large plants like trees or hauling away objects are not performed to avoid exhaustion.\n\nA completely novel feature is \"Auto Combat\". Achtung! has its own build in artificial intelligence that controls your colonists for you. All you have to do is to order a few colonists to their targets and they will get there on their own, keep a safe distance and shoot/position themselves intelligently until the job is done. Perfect for those occasions where you are busy dealing with a bigger issue. For now, this is an experimental feature and with more than a handful colonists or opponents will probably force your computer to its knees. But used smart it will be a useful feature!\n\n- Flexibility\n\nA few commands have different way to behave. Achtung! uses both: the ALT and the SHIFT key to modify the way it works. Hold SHIFT to move colonists relative to their current position. Hold ALT while right-clicking to draft your selected colonists before the operation and to suppress the context menu.\n\n-  Known errors and bugs\n\nAchtung! is developed with the user in mind. To stay compatible with other mods, Achtung! was developed to stay out of its way and does not overwrite any essential functions. Instead, it reuses existing functionality and probably works with 99% of other mods out of the box.\n\nHere are the current problems and their workarounds for the current version:\n\nAchtung! usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will \"clean\" the save and remove the dependency.\n\nThe jobs in Achtung have 1st priority (that's the whole point). They all force the colonist to work until done and if you don't keep an eye on them, they become unhappy or injured. Currently, there is a build-in prevention to avoid the worst but this option is not yet configurable and kicks only in as a last resort and cancels the job. But that's how we roll here at Achtung! Workaround: if you want the soft solution just schedule stuff and hope for the best ;-)\n\nThe new \"Auto Combat\" system is not optimized and will eat your CPU for breakfast. It probably will do stupid things and may not work as expected if you have exotic locations or mods that change the basic combat. Workaround: use it wisely and avoid too many colonists/enemies at the same time.\n\n-  Requirements\n\nAchtung! Mod works with RimWorld Alpha 14 and 15 and will get updated tightly with new RimWorld versions. I does not depend on any other mods and is known to work in any mod order you like.\n\n- Feedback\n\nWithout feedback, this mod would have never come so far. So please, send me feedback and rate and recommend my mod whenever possible. The three main places to do so are\n\n  - Ludeon Forums (https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=22130.0)\n  - Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/730936602)\n  - GitHub (https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld-Achtung-Mod)\n\n- FAQ\n\nAre there any videos showing Achtung! in action?\nYes, here's a youtube playlist: http://tinyurl.com/achtungmod\n\nDoes this alter my save files?\nNo, Achtung! changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!\n\nIs this mod compatible with other mods?\nMost likely. I don't know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The context menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.\n\nWhy is this called \"Achtung!\" ?\nIt's german for \"Attention!\" and used in the military as a command to line up soldiers.\n\nWhy do I need Auto Combat? Isn't this just the auto response thing already in the game?\nNot at all. For example: Once you get a raid or siege you cannot auto respond to it. First, those raiders are usually out of sight and second even if you get your colonists there they are usually drafted which means that they will just stand still once they're done. All this and a super smart positioning system will beat the living hell out of the build in auto response.\n\nI think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?\nAwesome! Please send see the Feedback section or send me email to andreas@pardeike.net\n\n- License\n\nFree. As in free beer.

Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load.

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

Different wood types have slightly different properties.\n\nWood may be painted in different colours. The available colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Black.\n\nA Woodworking table is available to paint wood or convert specific types of wood to the original wood type (generic wood).\n    ",

Click that.\nUse \"Reroll Map\" to get an entirely new starting map or \"Reroll Geysers\" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.\nEach operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.\n\nNote, that rerolling becomes unavailable after naming your colony or loading it from a save file.\n\nIf you are using Community Core Library (CCL) you might want to temporarily disable the minimap, as it covers up the button.\n",

It will probably take some getting used to, but in the long run, it will help me add some of the features that people frequently request.  I hope you like it!  With these changes, I rewrote a ton of the code in the mod.  This unfortunately will make it more likely that I made some mistakes, so please let me know if you run into bugs and be sure to make backups of your presets and saved colonists before modifying them!\r\n\r\nThis will _not_ work with the Alpha 16 version of the game.  You _must_ be running at least version 0.17.1542 of the game to use this test release of mod.\r\n\r\n**I recommend that you don't attempt to install this release if you're not comfortable with manual installs of RimWorld mods.  Wait instead for the final version of Alpha 17 to come out, after which your mod will auto-update via Steam Workshop.**\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.0.3.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.  By doing this manual install, you'll need to remember to remove it later when the workshop version is updated for Alpha 17.  The workshop version will not be updated until after Alpha 17 is complete."

    "description": "Colony Manager allows you to make colonists do the more tedious parts of managing a colony. Set up production chains from raw resources to finished products, and your managers will make sure you’re never out of vital resources again*. \n\n<size=24>Important</size>\n<b>Requires a new save game.</b>\nAdds a worktype, which is stored in the world, which means you need to start a new game after adding/removing this mod. \n\n<b>BETA VERSION</b>\nThis is the first release on A16, and alpha 16 is a biggy for anything that is even slightly related to mods. In theory, each map you’re on should get it’s own instance of the manager - circumventing any complications with multiple maps. This also means Manager jobs are NOT shared across multiple maps. In practice, there’s so many changes that I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a few odd bugs. Please, if you find any, report them here.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\n<b>Production Jobs</b>\n\n\nAssign ‘global’ bills, that will be assigned to workstations by your manager(s). \nSet start/stop conditions with the aid of a trigger. \nSelect which workstations bills should be assigned to by area and/or count, or select specific workstations. \nQuickly add jobs for ingredients in complex production chains \n\n<b>Hunting jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again! \nSet an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe! \n\n<b>Forestry jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again! \nAutomatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they’re working at maximum efficiency. \nSet an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there’s no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you. \n\n<b>Livestock jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd. \nRestrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding). \nAuto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications. \n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\nClear overview of all jobs \nShow stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year \nShow pawns capable of a job, and set work status \nPrioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies). \n\n<b>Import & Export</b>\n\n\nImport & export jobs between colonies, or share them with others! (Will likely throw at least a few errors when different mods are loaded - always back up your save before importing jobs from another world) \n\n<size=24>How does it work?</size>\nYou can manually set bills in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to hand out jobs to individual workstations \nPeriodically, the manager will check if the assigned bills are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete bills where required. The manager will not touch bills that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You’re still the overlord. \nIn theory there is no real limit to the number of global bills that can be set. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nRequires a new save. Adds a worktype, which in my tests gave errors on old savegames. \nShould work perfectly fine with other mods that add bills, assuming they do nothing too fancy/weird. (I’ve tested with various modpacks - screenshots were taken with the ModVarietyPack.) \n\n<size=24>Known Issues</size>\nSkills display on the colonist info pane gets cut off. This is an issue with the vanilla interface I’m not willing to change (it has too many possible conflicts). \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nKapTaiN KaVerN:    Minifiable research benches\nMoumix3:    Research tweaks\nduduluu:    Chinese translation\nKirill:    \nMossieuLeBlanc:    French translation\n\n",

It will probably take some getting used to, but in the long run, it will help me add some of the features that people frequently request.  I hope you like it!  With these changes, I rewrote a ton of the code in the mod.  This unfortunately will make it more likely that I made some mistakes, so please let me know if you run into bugs and be sure to make backups of your presets and saved colonists before modifying them!\r\n\r\nThis will _not_ work with the Alpha 16 version of the game.  You _must_ be running at least version 0.17.1542 of the game to use this test release of mod.\r\n\r\n**I recommend that you don't attempt to install this release if you're not comfortable with manual installs of RimWorld mods.  Wait instead for the final version of Alpha 17 to come out, after which your mod will auto-update via Steam Workshop.**\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.0.4.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.  By doing this manual install, you'll need to remember to remove it later when the workshop version is updated for Alpha 17.  The workshop version will not be updated until after Alpha 17 is complete."

    "description": "\n\tV1.17.0\nAdds a new playable race: The Elder Things.\n\nSharing biological features similar to fungus, amphibians, and plantlike organisms, the five-sided barrel-shaped entities known simply as the Elder Things are hardy creatures that can survive in most temperatures, enter trance-like sleep nearly indefinitely, survive deep space flight, and aside from suffering violent trauma, are effectively immortal.\\n\\nFurther information: Elder Things are genderless creatures that reproduce asexually through spores that are raised by the community. Their society is focused on large open spaces adorned by artwork and cylindrical furniture in pentagonal and other strange geometric structures. Due to advanced genetic engineering technology, they are responsible for the creation of the sentient slave protoplasmic race known as the Shoggoths, which turned against the Elder Things in centuries past and nearly destroyed their civilization. Even so, the Elder Things still rely on slave labor to maintain their decadent lifestyles and refuse to do labor that is beneath them.\n\t",

I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load.

(If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs.

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\nZhentar:    A17 update\nLauri7x3:    German translation\n\n",

(If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs.

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

This unfortunately will make it more likely that I made some mistakes, so please let me know if you run into bugs and be sure to make backups of your presets and saved colonists before modifying them!\r\n\r\nYou must be running at least version 0.17.1542 of the game to use this release of mod.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.1.3.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.  By doing this manual install, you'll need to remember to remove it later when the workshop version is updated for Alpha 17.  The workshop version will not be updated until after Alpha 17 is complete."

However, you can’t remove the mod from a game.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nAnimals (including humanoids) require reproductive organs to mate & and do lovin’. \n\n\nAdds reproductive organs to fleshy pawns (e.g., animals and colonists). \nSince reproductive organs are now a body part, they can be affected by external violence - including, but not limited to; gunfire, berserking colonists, frostbite, castration (neutering) and old age.\nReworks mating & lovin’ to take account of fertility stat. \n\n<size=24>Powered by Harmony</size>\n\n\n<size=24>Does this mod add the ability for colonists to have babies?</size>\n<i>No. Nor will I ever add this, so don’t ask.</i>\nThere’s a myriad of problems with adding colonist babies. There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations",

With these changes, I rewrote a ton of the code in the mod. This unfortunately will make it more likely that I made some mistakes, so please let me know if you run into bugs and be sure to make backups of your presets and saved colonists before modifying them!\r\n\r\nYou must be running at least version 0.17.1542 of the game to use this release of mod.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.1.4.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.  Never have more than one version of Prepare Carefully enabled at the same time."

(If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported.

    "description": "Adds reproductive organs to the animals, and then you, raiders and time can take them away again. \n\n<b>Does NOT require a new save game</b> \nShould be fine to use with any other mod that adds animals, races, relations, or anything else. However, you can’t remove the mod from a game.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nAnimals (including humanoids) require reproductive organs to mate & and do lovin’. \n\n\nAdds reproductive organs to fleshy pawns (e.g., animals and colonists). \nSince reproductive organs are now a body part, they can be affected by external violence - including, but not limited to; gunfire, berserking colonists, frostbite, castration (neutering) and old age.\nReworks mating & lovin’ to take account of fertility stat. \n\n<size=24>Powered by Harmony</size>\n\n\n<size=24>Does this mod add the ability for colonists to have babies?</size>\n<i>No. Nor will I ever add this, so don’t ask.</i>\nThere’s a myriad of problems with adding colonist babies. There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations",

Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.1.5.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.

The basic functionality is confirmed to work, but there may be more elusive bugs still to be caught.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nVarious usability extentions to the ‘vanilla’ work tab; \n\n\nWork types can be expanded to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type. \nTime scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allows you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc. \nUp to 9 priority levels (configurable)\nVarious small UX tweaks, e.g. scrolling to increase/decrease/toggle priorities.\n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nWith great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it’s a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk! \n\nFinally, there will never be an ‘autolabour’ mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a ‘bulletin board’ of jobs that need doing), it’s not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nBronytamin:    \nDuduluu:    \nEric Swanson:    \nDoctorVanGogh:    \n\n<size=24>Version</size>\nThis is version v0.17.0.5",

Check out RoxxPloxx's guide for more info here: https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki\n\nTotal list of components:\n\nCompAbilityUser\n - Adds spell/ability casting to humanlikes.\n\nCompActivatableEffect\n - Adds an activation graphic for weapons (e.g. lightsaber beam).\n\nCompDeflector\n - Allows the ability to knock projectiles to melee weapons.\n\nCompExtraSounds\n - Allows extra melee sounds to weapons.\n\nCompLumbering\n - Makes a staggered walking animation. (e.g. ATST walking effect)\n\nCompOversizedWeapon\n - Allows weapons with graphic sizes that can be bigger than RimWorld's limits.\n\nCompSlotLoadable\n - Adds slots to objects that can be filled to have effects. (e.g. different ammo types for guns, crystals for lightsabers)\n\nCompToggleDef (by Roxxploxx)\n- Allows for something to despawn, change its def, and respawn.\n\nCompVehicle (Experimental)\n - Allows for a pawn to be treated as a vehicle that can be loaded with pilots, gunners, crew, and passengers.\n\nCompInstalledPart (WIP)\n- Allows installation and uninstallation of things onto other things.

    "description": "Have you been wondering what the point of visiting factions is? Look no further, this mod is the answer.\r\n\r\n- Convince visitors to join your faction!\r\n- Increase faction relationships!\r\n- Treat visitors well by providing them with rooms, guest beds and joy activities!\r\n- Sell junk by placing it in their rooms!\r\n- Rescued characters can decide to join you!\r\n- Joining wanderers or refugees are firstly selected from related / well-known characters!\r\n\r\nYou can improve relationships by having your colonists entertain your guests. In return, using silver to improve relationships now gets more expensive every time you do it.\r\n\r\nIn order to recruit a guest, you have to increase their trust in your colonists. Hanging out with them will help, and having someone with a high social skill try and recruit them is required as well. The difficulty is based on how many colonists you already have. Once successful, they will join your faction right away.\r\n\r\nGuests stay in their selected area. Make sure you create an area specifically for guests (this is done with the area tools, just as with animals). \r\n\r\nTo please a visiting faction provide quality guest beds, joy objects, and a pretty environment. If they liked their stay, they might leave silver or items for you. It also affects your relationship with that faction. If the relationship with a visiting faction is high, they will also bring more silver and more items.\r\n\r\nIf you have items lying around in the guest area, guests will buy them if they like the item and have the money.\r\n",

    "description": "Overview:\nThis mod gives you the ability to craft your own prostheses and artificial organs. Starting with basic prostheses like a peg leg or a hook hand, you can research everything you can think about: Simple prostheses like the vanilla ones and some new, bionic body parts and even advanced bionics. But to get advanced bionics you have to do plenty of research and they're also pretty expensive to craft. \nIf you tend to lose your organs, this mod helps, too! You can research and craft surrogate and synthetic organs, so you never have to miss your kidney again! The mod is pretty big, there's enough work to do, so even in endgame there's something new to research, to craft and to buy available.\n \nCurrent main features:\n4 new workbenches \nCraft prostheses! There's a wide array from hook hands to exoskeleton suits and even brain implants!\nMany new parts like hook hands, a silent jaw, a brain stimulator, bionic spines, bionic hands and feet, advanced bionic eyes, medical ribs, exoskeleton suits, auxiliary AIs, cornea implants and many more!\nCraft organs! Go from rudimentary surrogate organs to high tech synthetic organs!\nCure brain damage using late game brain implants!\nTreat bad backs!\nFix scars!\nGive uranium a purpose! Upgrade bionics with this totally harmless material!\nStill not advanced enough? Buy rare Glitterworld Parts from traders\nNew traders: The textile trader and the prostheses trader!\nTons of new research projects!\nBe Frankenstein! Harvest organs and install them somewhere else!\nNot brutal enough? Mince spare natural body parts at the butcher table!\nAll prostheses have their own category and trade tag: Basic prostheses, simple prostheses...\n\nWhat you can do:\nI'd really appreciate it if you guys could give me feedback\nReport bugs!\nSuggest new parts or features!\nHave fun!",

    "description": "Allows building floors out of stuff*.\n\n<size=24>Important</size>\nThis mod <i>requires</i> Architect Sense to be loaded before it. \n\nYou can safely add this mod to you save games, but <i>you can not remove it</i> from save games. (If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\nDue to the extremely heavy-handed approach Erdelfs’ MinePlan Designator uses to inject his designators, <b>MinePlan Designator is incompatible with Architect Sense, and thus also with Stuffed Floors</b>.\n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs. It does however remove a number of designators from the architect in order to hide them from the user.\n\n<size=24>Powered by Harmony</size>\n\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nTelkir:    Permission to use textures for many of the floors\nCuproPanda:    Permission to use textures for even more floors\nPravus:    Permission to use textures for yet more floors\nDarkSlayerEx:    Original idea, texture tweaks and moral support\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\nDoctorVanGogh:    Add Extended Woodworking + Vegetable Garden obsoletions\n\n<size=24>Version</size>\nThis is version v0.17.1.3",

For now, the Production and Import & Export tabs have been disabled. The production tab will likely be permanently removed, and migrated to be it’s own mod. Import & Export has been buggy for a while, and needs to be rebuild.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\n<b>Production Jobs</b>\n == removed ==\n\n<b>Hunting jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again! \nSet an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe! \n\n<b>Forestry jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again! \nAutomatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they’re working at maximum efficiency. \nSet an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there’s no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you. \n\n<b>Livestock jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd. \nRestrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding). \nAuto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications. \n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\nClear overview of all jobs \nShow stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year \nShow pawns capable of a job, and set work status \nPrioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies). \n\n<b>Import & Export</b>\n == disabled ==\n\n<size=24>How does it work?</size>\nYou can manually set bills in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to hand out jobs to individual workstations \nPeriodically, the manager will check if the assigned bills are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete bills where required. The manager will not touch bills that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You’re still the overlord. \nIn theory there is no real limit to the number of global bills that can be set. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nRequires a new save.

It includes bug fixes for issues that were in the previous version, along with a new user interface for managing implants and bionics.\r\n\r\nYou should be running at least version 0.17.1557 of the game to use this release of mod.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Download the `EdBPrepareCarefully-0.17.1.6.zip` file.  Ignore the \"Source Code\" links.  You don't need those if you're just trying to install the mod.\r\n2. Find your RimWorld `Mods` directory. \r\n3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip into the `Mods` directory.  Make sure that you don't accidentally \"double-extract\" the contents.  You should have a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory, _not_ a `Mods/EdBPrepareCarefully/EdBPrepareCarefully` directory.\r\n4. If you're using Steam, be sure to disable the workshop version of the mod if you've subscribed to it.  It's very important that you only have the Alpha 17 version of the mod enabled when playing Alpha 17 and that you only have the Alpha 16 version of the mod enabled when you're playing Alpha 16.  Never have more than one version of Prepare Carefully enabled at the same time."

Check out RoxxPloxx's guide for more info here: https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki\n\nTotal list of components:\n\nCompAbilityUser\n - Adds spell/ability casting to humanlikes.\n\nCompActivatableEffect\n - Adds an activation graphic for weapons (e.g. lightsaber beam).\n\nCompDeflector\n - Allows the ability to knock projectiles to melee weapons.\n\nCompExtraSounds\n - Allows extra melee sounds to weapons.\n\nCompLumbering\n - Makes a staggered walking animation. (e.g. ATST walking effect)\n\nCompOversizedWeapon\n - Allows weapons with graphic sizes that can be bigger than RimWorld's limits.\n\nCompSlotLoadable\n - Adds slots to objects that can be filled to have effects. (e.g. different ammo types for guns, crystals for lightsabers)\n\nCompToggleDef (by Roxxploxx)\n- Allows for something to despawn, change its def, and respawn.\n\nCompVehicle (Experimental)\n - Allows for a pawn to be treated as a vehicle that can be loaded with pilots, gunners, crew, and passengers.\n\nCompInstalledPart (WIP)\n- Allows installation and uninstallation of things onto other things. This is particularly useful for weapons on vehicles.\n\nAdditions by roxxploxx.\nAdditions and transpilers by Erdelf.",

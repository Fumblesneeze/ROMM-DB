Set up production chains from raw resources to finished products, and your managers will make sure you’re never out of vital resources again*. \n\n<size=24>Important</size>\n<b>Requires a new save game.</b>\nAdds a worktype, which is stored in the world, which means you need to start a new game after adding/removing this mod. \n\n<b>BETA VERSION</b>\nThis is the first release on A16, and alpha 16 is a biggy for anything that is even slightly related to mods. In theory, each map you’re on should get it’s own instance of the manager - circumventing any complications with multiple maps. This also means Manager jobs are NOT shared across multiple maps. In practice, there’s so many changes that I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a few odd bugs. Please, if you find any, report them here.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\n<b>Production Jobs</b>\n\n\nAssign ‘global’ bills, that will be assigned to workstations by your manager(s). \nSet start/stop conditions with the aid of a trigger. \nSelect which workstations bills should be assigned to by area and/or count, or select specific workstations. \nQuickly add jobs for ingredients in complex production chains \n\n<b>Hunting jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again! \nSet an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe! \n\n<b>Forestry jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again! \nAutomatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they’re working at maximum efficiency. \nSet an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there’s no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you. \n\n<b>Livestock jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd. \nRestrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding). \nAuto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications. \n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\nClear overview of all jobs \nShow stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year \nShow pawns capable of a job, and set work status \nPrioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies). \n\n<b>Import & Export</b>\n\n\nImport & export jobs between colonies, or share them with others! (Will likely throw at least a few errors when different mods are loaded - always back up your save before importing jobs from another world) \n\n<size=24>How does it work?</size>\nYou can manually set bills in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to hand out jobs to individual workstations \nPeriodically, the manager will check if the assigned bills are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete bills where required. The manager will not touch bills that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You’re still the overlord. \nIn theory there is no real limit to the number of global bills that can be set. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nRequires a new save. Adds a worktype, which in my tests gave errors on old savegames. \nShould work perfectly fine with other mods that add bills, assuming they do nothing too fancy/weird. (I’ve tested with various modpacks - screenshots were taken with the ModVarietyPack.) \n\n<size=24>Known Issues</size>\nSkills display on the colonist info pane gets cut off.

These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

HugsLib must be loaded before Architect Sense, and Architect Sense must be loaded before Stuffed Floors.\n\nYou can safely add this mod to you save games, but <i>you can not remove it</i> from save games. (If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs. It does however remove a number of designators from the architect in order to hide them from the user.\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nTelkir:    Permission to use textures for many of the floors\nCuproPanda:    Permission to use textures for even more floors\nPravus:    Permission to use textures for yet more floors\nDarkSlayerEx:    Original idea, texture tweaks and moral support\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

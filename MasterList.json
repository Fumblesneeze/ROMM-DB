Set up production chains from raw resources to finished products, and your managers will make sure you’re never out of vital resources again*. \n\n<size=24>Important</size>\n<b>Requires a new save game.</b>\nAdds a worktype, which is stored in the world, which means you need to start a new game after adding/removing this mod. \n\n<b>BETA VERSION</b>\nThis is the first release on A16, and alpha 16 is a biggy for anything that is even slightly related to mods. In theory, each map you’re on should get it’s own instance of the manager - circumventing any complications with multiple maps. This also means Manager jobs are NOT shared across multiple maps. In practice, there’s so many changes that I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a few odd bugs. Please, if you find any, report them here.\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\n<b>Production Jobs</b>\n\n\nAssign ‘global’ bills, that will be assigned to workstations by your manager(s). \nSet start/stop conditions with the aid of a trigger. \nSelect which workstations bills should be assigned to by area and/or count, or select specific workstations. \nQuickly add jobs for ingredients in complex production chains \n\n<b>Hunting jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again! \nSet an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe! \n\n<b>Forestry jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again! \nAutomatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they’re working at maximum efficiency. \nSet an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there’s no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you. \n\n<b>Livestock jobs</b>\n\n\nSet a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd. \nRestrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding). \nAuto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications. \n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\nClear overview of all jobs \nShow stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year \nShow pawns capable of a job, and set work status \nPrioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies). \n\n<b>Import & Export</b>\n\n\nImport & export jobs between colonies, or share them with others! (Will likely throw at least a few errors when different mods are loaded - always back up your save before importing jobs from another world) \n\n<size=24>How does it work?</size>\nYou can manually set bills in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to hand out jobs to individual workstations \nPeriodically, the manager will check if the assigned bills are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete bills where required. The manager will not touch bills that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You’re still the overlord. \nIn theory there is no real limit to the number of global bills that can be set. \n\n<size=24>Notes</size>\nRequires a new save. Adds a worktype, which in my tests gave errors on old savegames. \nShould work perfectly fine with other mods that add bills, assuming they do nothing too fancy/weird. (I’ve tested with various modpacks - screenshots were taken with the ModVarietyPack.) \n\n<size=24>Known Issues</size>\nSkills display on the colonist info pane gets cut off.

These mods do pretty much exactly the same thing (in fact we both use the same vanilla methods for the actual hauling). The main difference is in how we keep track of what can be merged. Stockpile Efficiency searches for stacks that can potentially be merged whenever a pawn is looking for something to merge. Stack Merger keeps a permanent cache of stacks that can be merged. I haven’t run any benchmarks, but I expect my mod to have a mostly constant, relatively low cpu load. Stockpile Efficiency will have no load as long as pawns don’t have time to do the hauling jobs, but when they search for things to merge the cpu load will most likely be considerably larger. \n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

HugsLib must be loaded before Architect Sense, and Architect Sense must be loaded before Stuffed Floors.\n\nYou can safely add this mod to you save games, but <i>you can not remove it</i> from save games. (If you really must do this, you’ll have to remove all built stuffed floors added by this mod first).\n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nThis mod does two things. First, using Architect Sense it provides a framework for modders to define their own stuffed floor types. Second, it uses this framework to create a number of new floors that are stuffed. \n\n<b>For players</b>\nAdds several floor types (borrowed with permission from Telkir’s More Floors, CuproPanda’s Extra Floors and Pravus’ Fences and Floors) in a variety of stone, wood and metal types.\n\nWorks great with other mods that add more resources, e.g. Minerals and Materials Kura’s Extra Minerals, Extended Woodworking, Vegetable Garden and GlitterTech. \n\nThis mod also organizes and where needed, removes the floors added by Vanilla RimWorld, More Floors, Extended Woodworking, Minerals and Materials, GlitterTech, More Furniture, Vegetable Garden and Floored.\n\n<b>For modders</b>\nAdds a custom FloorTypeDef that derives from TerrainDef, and allows modders to create floortypes by setting a texture (grayscale for best effect, will be coloured by stuff) and a list of stuffCategories to generate terrain defs for. The resulting designators will be placed together in a category, and any vanilla or other mod’s terrains made obsolete can also be provided in the XML, and will then be hidden for the user (but not removed, so it won’t break save games).\n\n<size=24>Known issues</size>\nWhile this mod will happily generate more floors for any mods that add materials to the metallic, stony and/or woody stuff types, it only cleans up the floors added by mods that are explicitly supported. Any other mods that add floor types may appear as duplicates. If you encounter such an issue, or know of mods that add more floors, please let me know! \n\n<size=24>Technical details</size>\n*: This mod doesn’t actually allow building stuffed floors. Rather, it spoofs this behaviour by generating TerrainDefs for each of the stuffDefs handed to it, and then using ArchitectSense to group these terrains together and give a user experience similar to stuff selection on buildings. This mod doesn’t do anything destructive, it doesn’t make any detours, and doesn’t remove any defs. It does however remove a number of designators from the architect in order to hide them from the user.\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nTelkir:    Permission to use textures for many of the floors\nCuproPanda:    Permission to use textures for even more floors\nPravus:    Permission to use textures for yet more floors\nDarkSlayerEx:    Original idea, texture tweaks and moral support\nduduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

    "description": "Command your colonists like a boss!\n\nAchtung! Mod enhances how you control RimWorld and reduces the number of clicks by half. And almost no dependencies in your save files (read more about this below).\n\nThese enhancements can be divided into the following areas:\n\n- Automatic drafting/undrafting of colonists\n\nWouldn't it be nice to not micro-manage the drafting status of your colonists? With Achtung! you can.\n\nWith Achtung! the context menu contains all possible actions regardless of the current drafting status of the selected colonist. Once you select an action Achtung! automatically changes the drafting status if necessary to execute the action.\n\n- Control multiple colonists at once\n\nSave time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose \"melee\". Done.\n\nAchtung! combines all possible actions into one MultiAction(tm) context menu and shows you how many colonists can execute a certain action by appending a multiplier at the end of the menu item.\n\n- Position your colonists like in the military\n\nThis is where the name \"Achtung!\" comes from. It's the german word used to get the attention of soldiers and which is usually followed by a line-up in front of the commander.\n\nWithin RimWorld in combat, you want your colonists neatly positioned along a line or equally spaced in all your door openings. This is really easy with Achtung! Select multiple colonists, and with the right mouse button, drag along a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!\n\n- Important tasks\n\nSome tasks are too important to be interrupted. Like cleaning that hospital room so nobody gets infected. That's why Achtung! has a few extra commands that will make sure that something is really done well. For now, this is \"Clean Room\", \"Fight Fire\", \"Sow Zone/Room\" and the new \"Auto Combat\". More are planned in the future.\n\nWhen you choose \"Clean Room\", the colonist(s) will start cleaning the room until you stop them or the room is really clean. They will check the room while cleaning so that it doesn't matter if other colonists might introduce new filth while the cleaning is ongoing.\n\nThe command \"Fight Fire\" works outside the home area and is useful if you don't want to extend the home area just to get rid of a fire.\n\nChoosing \"Sow Zone/Room\" will make sure that the zone selected or all growing inside a room will be sowed completely. Time consuming tasks like removing other large plants like trees or hauling away objects are not performed to avoid exhaustion.\n\nA completely novel feature is \"Auto Combat\". Achtung! has its own build in artificial intelligence that controls your colonists for you. All you have to do is to order a few colonists to their targets and they will get there on their own, keep a safe distance and shoot/position themselves intelligently until the job is done. Perfect for those occasions where you are busy dealing with a bigger issue. For now, this is an experimental feature and with more than a handful colonists or opponents will probably force your computer to its knees. But used smart it will be a useful feature!\n\n- Flexibility\n\nA few commands have different way to behave. Achtung! uses both: the ALT and the SHIFT key to modify the way it works. Hold SHIFT to move colonists relative to their current position. Hold ALT while right-clicking to draft your selected colonists before the operation and to suppress the context menu.\n\n-  Known errors and bugs\n\nAchtung! is developed with the user in mind. To stay compatible with other mods, Achtung! was developed to stay out of its way and does not overwrite any essential functions. Instead, it reuses existing functionality and probably works with 99% of other mods out of the box.\n\nHere are the current problems and their workarounds for the current version:\n\nAchtung! usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will \"clean\" the save and remove the dependency.\n\nThe jobs in Achtung have 1st priority (that's the whole point). They all force the colonist to work until done and if you don't keep an eye on them, they become unhappy or injured. Currently, there is a build-in prevention to avoid the worst but this option is not yet configurable and kicks only in as a last resort and cancels the job. But that's how we roll here at Achtung! Workaround: if you want the soft solution just schedule stuff and hope for the best ;-)\n\nThe new \"Auto Combat\" system is not optimized and will eat your CPU for breakfast. It probably will do stupid things and may not work as expected if you have exotic locations or mods that change the basic combat. Workaround: use it wisely and avoid too many colonists/enemies at the same time.\n\n-  Requirements\n\nAchtung! Mod works with RimWorld Alpha 14 and 15 and will get updated tightly with new RimWorld versions. I does not depend on any other mods and is known to work in any mod order you like.\n\n- Feedback\n\nWithout feedback, this mod would have never come so far. So please, send me feedback and rate and recommend my mod whenever possible. The three main places to do so are\n\n  - Ludeon Forums (https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=22130.0)\n  - Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/730936602)\n  - GitHub (https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld-Achtung-Mod)\n\n- FAQ\n\nAre there any videos showing Achtung! in action?\nYes, here's a youtube playlist: http://tinyurl.com/achtungmod\n\nDoes this alter my save files?\nNo, Achtung! changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!\n\nIs this mod compatible with other mods?\nMost likely. I don't know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The context menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.\n\nWhy is this called \"Achtung!\" ?\nIt's german for \"Attention!\" and used in the military as a command to line up soldiers.\n\nWhy do I need Auto Combat? Isn't this just the auto response thing already in the game?\nNot at all. For example: Once you get a raid or siege you cannot auto respond to it. First, those raiders are usually out of sight and second even if you get your colonists there they are usually drafted which means that they will just stand still once they're done. All this and a super smart positioning system will beat the living hell out of the build in auto response.\n\nI think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?\nAwesome! Please send see the Feedback section or send me email to andreas@pardeike.net\n\n- License\n\nFree. As in free beer.

    "description": "Adds reproductive organs to the animals, and then you, raiders and time can take them away again. \n\n<size=24>Important</size>\n<b>Requires HugsLib</b> \n\n<b>Does NOT require a new save game</b> \nThis mod uses CCL to dynamically change game data* when a game is loaded. Should be fine to use with any other mod that adds animals, races, relations, or anything else. \n\n<size=24>Features</size>\nAnimals (including humanoids) require reproductive organs to mate & and do lovin’. \n\n\nAdds reproductive organs to fleshy pawns (e.g., animals and colonists). \nSince reproductive organs are now a body part, they can be affected by external violence - including, but not limited to; gunfire, berserking colonists, frostbite, castration (neutering) and old age.\nReworks mating & lovin’ to take account of fertility stat. \n\n<size=24>Does this mod add the ability for colonists to have babies?</size>\n<i>No. Nor will I ever add this, so don’t ask.</i>\nThere’s a myriad of problems with adding colonist babies. There’s moral/ethical issues, but I don’t particularly care about those, I don’t see why making baby leather hats is worse than prisoner leather hats. \n\nWhat I do care about is gameplay. For me, two things are required to make babies actually fun. \n\nFirst, there needs to be systems around babies. If they’re just colonists or animals in behaviour, I don’t see the point. You’d have to have various interactions from parents with their children, amongst children, children with the environment, etc. etc. to really bring children alive. Then you’d also want to build in things like schools or at least some sort of internships/apprenticeships, the list goes on and on. \nThe problem with all of this is that it takes a huge amount of work - including a number of new gameplay mechanics. It’s something better suited for Tynan himself to add to the game. \n\nSecond, the timescale just doesn’t work. The average colony will last a couple of years, 10 if you’re in it for the long haul. Only rarely do colonies last longer than that. That would mean that there’s not really any room for progression, and I don’t see the fun in that. Adding cloning vats, time chambers, gro-quick drugs or whatever are weak solutions for a fundamental problem, and I don’t want to go that way. Changing the games timescale is pretty much impossible for mods to do. \n\n<i>TLDR; if you want babies, go ask Tynan.</i>\n\n<size=24>Contributors</size>\n\nkouyou:    Japanese translation\nDuduluu:    Chinese translations\n\n",

    "description": "Command your colonists like a boss!\n\nAchtung! Mod enhances how you control RimWorld and reduces the number of clicks by half. And almost no dependencies in your save files (read more about this below).\n\nThese enhancements can be divided into the following areas:\n\n- Automatic drafting/undrafting of colonists\n\nWouldn't it be nice to not micro-manage the drafting status of your colonists? With Achtung! you can.\n\nWith Achtung! the context menu contains all possible actions regardless of the current drafting status of the selected colonist. Once you select an action Achtung! automatically changes the drafting status if necessary to execute the action.\n\n- Control multiple colonists at once\n\nSave time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose \"melee\". Done.\n\nAchtung! combines all possible actions into one MultiAction(tm) context menu and shows you how many colonists can execute a certain action by appending a multiplier at the end of the menu item.\n\n- Position your colonists like in the military\n\nThis is where the name \"Achtung!\" comes from. It's the german word used to get the attention of soldiers and which is usually followed by a line-up in front of the commander.\n\nWithin RimWorld in combat, you want your colonists neatly positioned along a line or equally spaced in all your door openings. This is really easy with Achtung! Select multiple colonists, and with the right mouse button, drag along a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!\n\n- Important tasks\n\nSome tasks are too important to be interrupted. Like cleaning that hospital room so nobody gets infected. That's why Achtung! has a few extra commands that will make sure that something is really done well. For now, this is \"Clean Room\", \"Fight Fire\", \"Sow Zone/Room\" and the new \"Auto Combat\". More are planned in the future.\n\nWhen you choose \"Clean Room\", the colonist(s) will start cleaning the room until you stop them or the room is really clean. They will check the room while cleaning so that it doesn't matter if other colonists might introduce new filth while the cleaning is ongoing.\n\nThe command \"Fight Fire\" works outside the home area and is useful if you don't want to extend the home area just to get rid of a fire.\n\nChoosing \"Sow Zone/Room\" will make sure that the zone selected or all growing inside a room will be sowed completely. Time consuming tasks like removing other large plants like trees or hauling away objects are not performed to avoid exhaustion.\n\nA completely novel feature is \"Auto Combat\". Achtung! has its own build in artificial intelligence that controls your colonists for you. All you have to do is to order a few colonists to their targets and they will get there on their own, keep a safe distance and shoot/position themselves intelligently until the job is done. Perfect for those occasions where you are busy dealing with a bigger issue. For now, this is an experimental feature and with more than a handful colonists or opponents will probably force your computer to its knees. But used smart it will be a useful feature!\n\n- Flexibility\n\nA few commands have different way to behave. Achtung! uses both: the ALT and the SHIFT key to modify the way it works. Hold SHIFT to move colonists relative to their current position. Hold ALT while right-clicking to draft your selected colonists before the operation and to suppress the context menu.\n\n-  Known errors and bugs\n\nAchtung! is developed with the user in mind. To stay compatible with other mods, Achtung! was developed to stay out of its way and does not overwrite any essential functions. Instead, it reuses existing functionality and probably works with 99% of other mods out of the box.\n\nHere are the current problems and their workarounds for the current version:\n\nAchtung! usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will \"clean\" the save and remove the dependency.\n\nThe jobs in Achtung have 1st priority (that's the whole point). They all force the colonist to work until done and if you don't keep an eye on them, they become unhappy or injured. Currently, there is a build-in prevention to avoid the worst but this option is not yet configurable and kicks only in as a last resort and cancels the job. But that's how we roll here at Achtung! Workaround: if you want the soft solution just schedule stuff and hope for the best ;-)\n\nThe new \"Auto Combat\" system is not optimized and will eat your CPU for breakfast. It probably will do stupid things and may not work as expected if you have exotic locations or mods that change the basic combat. Workaround: use it wisely and avoid too many colonists/enemies at the same time.\n\n-  Requirements\n\nAchtung! Mod works with RimWorld Alpha 14 and 15 and will get updated tightly with new RimWorld versions. I does not depend on any other mods and is known to work in any mod order you like.\n\n- Feedback\n\nWithout feedback, this mod would have never come so far. So please, send me feedback and rate and recommend my mod whenever possible. The three main places to do so are\n\n  - Ludeon Forums (https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=22130.0)\n  - Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/730936602)\n  - GitHub (https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld-Achtung-Mod)\n\n- FAQ\n\nAre there any videos showing Achtung! in action?\nYes, here's a youtube playlist: http://tinyurl.com/achtungmod\n\nDoes this alter my save files?\nNo, Achtung! changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!\n\nIs this mod compatible with other mods?\nMost likely. I don't know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The context menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.\n\nWhy is this called \"Achtung!\" ?\nIt's german for \"Attention!\" and used in the military as a command to line up soldiers.\n\nWhy do I need Auto Combat? Isn't this just the auto response thing already in the game?\nNot at all. For example: Once you get a raid or siege you cannot auto respond to it. First, those raiders are usually out of sight and second even if you get your colonists there they are usually drafted which means that they will just stand still once they're done. All this and a super smart positioning system will beat the living hell out of the build in auto response.\n\nI think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?\nAwesome! Please send see the Feedback section or send me email to andreas@pardeike.net\n\n- License\n\nFree. As in free beer. Copy, learn and be respectful.\nPowered by Harmony Patch Library\n\n- Contact\n\nAndreas Pardeike\nEmail: andreas@pardeike.net\nSteam: pardeike\nTwitter: @pardeike",
